Every client that joins Huma, whether medical organisation, pharmaceutical or other, can have a custom platform configured specifically for their needs from the Admin Portal. The Organisation set up includes adding a name, legal documentation and defining their key activity; either clinical trials or remote patient monitoring. 
## How it worksâ€‹
In the **Admin Portal**, go to the Organisation tab and click **New organisation**.

In the pop-out window, enter a name for your organisation, select a **View Type** and add links to your **privacy policy**, **EULA** (software agreement), and **terms and conditions** (just use the same link if this is the same as the EULA).

For DCT deployments, you can also optionally choose to include a **Study completion target** which shows a % of the patients who completed the trial compared to the target on the deployment list view in the Clinician Portal. 
Once you have completed these details, save the organisation and it will be listed on the **Organisations** tab. On the list, you can see the organisation name, enrollment target, study completion target and the number of deployments associated with it.

To make any changes to the Organisation, open the dropdown menu at the end of the row and select **Edit**.

You can edit any of the fields and also remove any deployments you might have added.
