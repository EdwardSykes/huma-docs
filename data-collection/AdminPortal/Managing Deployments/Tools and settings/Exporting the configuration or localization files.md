Once you have configured a new deployment, you can export a JSON file of the full configuration so that you can recreate it in the future or in order to integrate it with another tool. 
You can also export a different JSON containing all the copy from your deployment so that you can translate it. 
## How it works
In the Admin Portal, find your list of deployments on the **Deployments** tab. Open the dropdown menu at the end of the row and select **Export JSON** or **Generate file to translate** depending on whether you want the full code for the deployment or just the content to be translated.

A file will be downloaded to your device in JSON. The localisation file can be reuploaded in the Languages section of the **App Configuration**.
> In the case of the localisation file, please note that once you have downloaded it, your deployment configuration will be locked and you wonâ€™t be able to make any changes. For the full procedure, please refer to this documentation.
