Huma is designed principally for either clinical research trials (CRT) or remote patient monitoring (RPM). The app features that are delivered to patients can vary depending on the specific needs of their program. 
## How it worksâ€‹
From the **Admin Portal**, go to the **App features** tab, under **General Settings**.

### App menu
You can choose which tabs appear in the Huma App. There are two pre-configured options that you can select from the dropdown: **Legacy** or **Timeline**.  

If you click the **Show advanced options** link, you can see the menu items for each configuration. The Legacy option includes **Care plan, Key actions, Learn**, and **Profile**.

The Timeline option includes **To do, Track, Learn**, and **Profile**.

### App features
Check the features on the list that you want to include for your users:
- **Appointment** - This feature lets clinicians schedule appointments with their patients or call them directly sing the in-app telemedicine video or audio call functionality
