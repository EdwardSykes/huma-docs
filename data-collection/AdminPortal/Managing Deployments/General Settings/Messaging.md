Huma takes clinician-patient communication seriously. Messages can be configured in the deployment so that clinicians can send out pre-built messages designed to address specific issues quickly. In addition to this, custom messaging allows clinicians to write their own personalised messages to patients.
## How it worksâ€‹
When configuring your deployment, in the **App features**, check the **Messaging** checkbox to enable messaging. 
Check **Allow custom messaging** to allow clinicians to compose their own messages.
 
You can add some standard messages to your portal. Click **Add message** button to create a new one.


The edit window will pop out and you can enter your message content.

Clinicians will be able to select from your list of custom messages to communicate important information to their patients .
