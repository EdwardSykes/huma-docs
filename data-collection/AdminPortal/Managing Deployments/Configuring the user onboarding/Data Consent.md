As the Huma platform processes patient data, it’s important to let them know what is done with that data along with the company privacy policy and terms and conditions. There are three Data Consent onboarding modules within the Huma platform that can be configured to the needs of the organisation. The information you enter here, as well as appearing in the onboarding module, will be accessible to users view links on their Profile page.  
Note that the eConsent module is specifically for patients participating in clinical trials and is required for compliance.
## How it works​
When creating a new deployment, you can add the **Consent** module by selecting either **Consent or Legitimate Interest**, or by using the **Empty Consent Template** to start from scratch. Please consult the Legal team (legal@huma.com) to determine which is appropriate for your organisation.
Whichever option you choose, it will be listed in the onboarding modules as **Consent**. Consent modules are configured in English (as indicated by ‘UK’) but the template can be configured for other languages.

Click the **Edit✎** icon at the end of the row to configure the module.
> Note that the details may vary depending on the country. For the purpose of this guide, we will look at the configuration needed for EU regions who are regulated by GDPR guidelines.
**General** - This section specifies the user who needs to consent. In this case, as it is the user’s data being processed, only User should be checked.

**Signature** - Check this box if user signature is required. In the fields, you can edit the placement text which instructs the user how to complete the fields, or leave as the default.

If you want to include a middle name as part of the signature, check the Has middle name checkbox. 
Show first last name - Ensure this is checked so user name and surname is requested.
**Sections** - The sections listed in the consent module can be edited, removed and added to in order to configure the module to your specifications. Just click the Edit✎ icon at the end of the row to change the Type, Title and Details of the section.
