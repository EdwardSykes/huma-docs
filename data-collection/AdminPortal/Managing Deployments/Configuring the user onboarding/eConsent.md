When collecting data for clinical research trials in a digital environment, participants who opt in must sign an electronic consent form to agree to how their data will be used. 
The eConsent module is used to build a **Patient information and informed consent** form, which must be read and consented to via signature by the patient so that they can participate in the trial.
## How it works​
In the **Onboarding** tab, select **eConsent** from the list of onboarding modules and click the **Edit✎** icon to open the module details.

**General** - Add a title to the consent form and some intro text. You should also add the contact details of someone they can contact for more details. 
**User types** - Select User as it is the patient who needs to give their consent, even if the proxy is helping them to input their data. 

**EConsent sections** - You can add more sections to your consent form if needed. Click the **Add section** button and complete the details in the pop-out window.

You’ll need to select the section type from the dropdown window, then add a Title, Image or video and a description.

**Additional consent questions** - You can also add additional questions to your consent form. Click to **Add question** and fill in the details in the pop-out window.

Select the purpose of the data collection from the dropdown: **for research or for future studies**.

When including this module in the onboarding, ensure that it comes after the **Data consent and Identity verification** modules.
## Patient experience
When first logging into the Huma App, patients will be taken through the privacy policy and terms and conditions and will be asked to consent. On receipt of the patient signature, Huma will generate an electronic informed consent (eICF) PDF.
Participants can easily withdraw their consent at any time without having to search for it or contact a customer support representative. From the **Profile** area of their app, they can view their informed consent forms and simply click the button to Withdraw consent.
