When participating in Huma clinical trials or remote monitoring, every patient has to enter some profile details that are shared with their care team. Whatever the aims of your trial, you have the option to fully customise what profile details you request from your patients using the **Custom Fields** feature. 
## How it works
In the **Profile** configuration tab, under **Overall settings**, you can add custom fields. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Add custom field**.

After adding a name for your field, click the down arrow to open up the rest of the form.
