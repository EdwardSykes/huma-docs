title: Patient Activation
---

Patient activation refers to the refers to the knowledge, skills and confidence a patient has with regards to their own health and managing their healthcare. 

The Patient Activation questionnaires aim to measure how engaged a patient is with their healthcare and shares these responses with their care team.

## How it works

The questionnaires ask subjective questions that help assess patient engagement. Patient reponses are shared with care teams in the Clinician Portal where they can look for trends and responses that might require attention.
