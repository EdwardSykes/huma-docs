title: COVID-19 Baseline Questionnaire
---

** Taking a closer look at the heart. **

Bringing Patients into the Huma product includes an easy way of collecting information about their health with respect to COVID-19. Answering all questions and sharing this information will allow Care Teams to make better treatment decisions.

## How it works

Patients will answer questions in the Huma app about tests and symptoms of COVID-19 for the previous month. Care Teams can view new and historical results in the Clinician Portal and be informed of severity.

### Patients
 
From signing in for the first time, Patients will be prompted to complete the COVID-19 Baseline Questionnaire. From here, the Patient can answer questions on symptoms and tests in the previous month.

### Clinicians

In the Clinician Portal, on the Patient List, Clinicians can view a table of Patients. The COVID-19 Baseline column will display the last recorded reading indicated as a Red Amber Green indicator to inform severity.

Clicking on the Patient row takes the Clinician to the Patient Summary, where Care Teams can view all vitals. By selecting the COVID-19 Baseline, all historical data can be displayed as a graph or a table of results.
