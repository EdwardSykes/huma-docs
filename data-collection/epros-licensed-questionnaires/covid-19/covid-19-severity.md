title: COVID-19 Severity Risk Score Questionnaire
---


Huma aims to model the risk of individuals developing complications due to COVID-19, given routinely collected symptoms, demographic, pre-existing conditions, and vital signs that could all be collected via the Huma app.  

## How it works

Patients will answer questions in the Huma app about tests and symptoms of COVID-19. Care Teams can view new and historical results in the Clinician Portal and be informed of severity.

### Patients
 
From the home screen, Patients can select the COVID-19 Severity Risk Score Questionnaire, which will take the Patient through a series of measurements and questions.

### Clinicians

In the Clinician Portal, on the Patient List, Clinicians can view a table of Patients. The COVID-19 Severity Risk Score column will display the last recorded reading indicated as a Red Amber Green indicator to inform severity.

Clicking on the Patient row takes the Clinician to the Patient Summary, where Care Teams can view all vitals. By selecting the COVID-19 Severity Risk Score, all historical data can be displayed as a graph or a table of results."
