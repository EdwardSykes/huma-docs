title: COVID-19 Monthly Questionnaire
---

** Remote population monitoring for COVID-19 in the Fenland cohort **

The Fenland Study for COVID-19 is looking to gather data on how many people have evidence in their blood of previous infection with COVID-19 and then to investigate whether it is possible to identify the COVID-19 pre-symptomatic phase using measurements of signs and symptoms collected via the Huma App. This information will help scientists develop better measures of early detection.

## How it works

Patients will answer questions in the Huma app about tests and symptoms of COVID-19 for the previous month. Care Teams can view new and historical results in the Clinician Portal and be informed of severity.

### Patients

In the Huma app, patients can select Questionnaire and the COVID-19 Monthly Questionnaire from the Track screen. From here, the Patient can answer questions on symptoms and tests in the previous month.

From within the module, Patients can select "View previous entries" and review historical records.

### Clinicians

In the Clinician Portal, on the Patient List, Clinicians can view a table of Patients. The COVID-19 Monthly column will display the last recorded reading indicated as a Red Amber Green indicator to inform severity.

Clicking on the Patient row takes the Clinician to the Patient Summary, where Care Teams can view all vitals. By selecting the COVID-19 Monthly all historical data can be displayed as a graph or a table of results.
