The questionnaire feature is an easy way of collecting information about a person's health who does not require to be admitted overnight. Answering all questions and sharing this information will allow a person's care team to make better treatment decisions.

## How it works



### Patients
 
In the Huma app, patients can select Questionnaire and the Outpatient Monthly Questionnaire from the Track screen. From here, the Patient can answer questions on symptoms and tests in the previous month.

From within the module, Patients can select "View previous entries" and review historical records.

### Clinicians

In the Clinician Portal, on the Patient List, Clinicians can view a table of Patients. The Outpatient column will display the last recorded reading indicated as a Red Amber Green indicator to inform severity.

Clicking on the Patient row takes the Clinician to the Patient Summary, where Care Teams can view all vitals. By selecting the Outpatient, all historical data can be displayed as a graph or a table of results.
