title: Food Security Questionnaire
---

** Remote population monitoring for COVID-19 in the Fenland cohort **

Food security exists when people have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. The Food Security Questionnaire assesses how participants feel about their access to food through the COVID-19 period.

## How it works

Patients will answer questions in the Huma app about tests and symptoms of COVID-19 for the previous month. From there, Research Teams can view new and historical results in the Clinician Portal.

### Patients

In the Huma app, patients can select Questionnaire and the Food Security Questionnaire from the Track screen, which will take the Patient through a series of questions.

From within the module, Patients can select "View previous entries" and review historical records.

### Food Security Questionnaire

### Clinicians

In the Clinician Portal, on the Patient List, Clinicians can view a table of Patients, from which the Food Security column will display the last recorded reading.

Clicking on the Patient row takes the Clinician to the Patient Summary, where Care Teams can view all vitals. By selecting Food Security, all historical data can be displayed as a graph or a table of results.
