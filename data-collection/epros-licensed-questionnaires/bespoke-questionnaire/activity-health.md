** Self-reported changes in diet and physical activity **

Furthermore, eating healthy and being active can help you maintain a healthy weight, which is vital for the overall quality of lifestyle. Finally, being active and eating healthy can help improve your mental health and mood.

## How it works

Patients will answer questions in the Huma app about the activity taken and food consumed in the previous seven days. Care Teams can view new and historical results in the Clinician Portal and be informed of severity.

### Patients
 
In the Huma app, patients can select Questionnaire and the Activity and Health Questionnaire from the Track screen. From here, the Patient can answer questions about the week that just passed compared to the previous week.

From the module, Patients can select "View previous entries" and review historical records.

### Clinicians

In the Clinician Portal, on the Patient List, Clinicians can view a table of Patients. The Activity and Health column will display the last recorded reading indicated as a Red Amber Green indicator to inform severity.

Clicking on the Patient row takes the Clinician to the Patient Summary, where Care Teams can view all vitals. By selecting the Activity and Health, all historical data can be displayed as a graph or a table of results.
