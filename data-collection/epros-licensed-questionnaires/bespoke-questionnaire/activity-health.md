** Self-reported changes in diet and physical activity **

There are many reasons why being active and eating healthy is essential. For one, it can help improve your overall health and well-being. Furthermore, eating healthy and being active can help you maintain a healthy weight, which is vital for the overall quality of lifestyle. Finally, being active and eating healthy can help improve your mental health and mood.

## How it works

Patients will answer questions in the Huma app about the activity taken and food consumed in the previous seven days. Care Teams can view new and historical results in the Clinician Portal and be informed of severity.

### Patients
 
In the Huma app, patients can select Questionnaire and the Activity and Health Questionnaire from the Track screen. From here, the Patient can answer questions about the week that just passed compared to the previous week.

From the module, Patients can select "View previous entries" and review historical records.
