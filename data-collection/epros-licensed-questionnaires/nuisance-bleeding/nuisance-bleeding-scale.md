title: Nuisance Bleeding Scale Questionnaire
---


Nuisance bleeding is any bleeding that is considered to be a nuisance or annoyance rather than a medical emergency. It can include bleeding from minor cuts or scrapes, nosebleeds, or bleeding from the gums. While nuisance bleeding is not usually severe, it can be a sign of a more serious condition if it occurs frequently or is accompanied by other symptoms.

## How it works

Patients can report their Nuisance Bleeding by answering questions on their observations in areas of concern. Answers can be provided to Care Teams to help with health care decisions.

### Patients
 
In the Huma app, patients can select Questionnaire and the Nuisance Bleeding Questionnaire from the Track screen. From here, the Patient can answer questions on symptoms and tests in the previous month.

From within the module, Patients can select "View previous entries" and review historical records.

### Clinicians

In the Clinician Portal, on the Patient List, Clinicians can view a table of Patients. The Nuisance Bleeding Scale column will display the last recorded reading indicated as a Red Amber Green indicator to inform severity.

Clicking on the Patient row takes the Clinician to the Patient Summary, where Care Teams can view all vitals. By selecting the Nuisance Bleeding Scale, all historical data can be displayed as a graph or a table of results.
