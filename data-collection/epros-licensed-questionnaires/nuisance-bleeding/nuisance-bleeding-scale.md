title: Nuisance Bleeding Scale Questionnaire
---


Nuisance bleeding is any bleeding that is considered to be a nuisance or annoyance rather than a medical emergency. It can include bleeding from minor cuts or scrapes, nosebleeds, or bleeding from the gums. While nuisance bleeding is not usually severe, it can be a sign of a more serious condition if it occurs frequently or is accompanied by other symptoms.

## How it works

Patients can report their Nuisance Bleeding by answering questions on their observations in areas of concern. Answers can be provided to Care Teams to help with health care decisions.

### Patients
 
In the Huma app, patients can select Questionnaire and the Nuisance Bleeding Questionnaire from the Track screen. From here, the Patient can answer questions on symptoms and tests in the previous month.

From within the module, Patients can select "View previous entries" and review historical records.
