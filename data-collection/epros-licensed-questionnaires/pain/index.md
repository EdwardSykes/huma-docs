title: Pain

Pain is the experience of discomfort in the body which can seriously impact a patient's quality of life. Pain can be the results of a specific injury or may also be an indicator of other medical issues. Huma's pain questionnaires allow patients to explain and share the pain they are experiencing with care teams.

## How it works

The questionnaires ask questions about how the patient feels in terms of their pain. Results are shared with care teams via the Clinician Portal where they can look for trends and prioritise accordingly.
