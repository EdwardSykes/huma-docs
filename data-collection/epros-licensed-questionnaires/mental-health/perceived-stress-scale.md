The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a questionnaire that measures the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. The items ask and score how often the respondent has felt certain ways during the past month, with higher scores indicating greater levels of perceived stress.

## How it works

The questions in the Huma Percieved Stress Scale ask about the Patients feelings and thoughts during the last month in order to understand how different situations affect feelings and perceived stress. This information is shared with care teams in order to help make healthcare decisions.

### Patient

In the Huma app, patients can select Questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) Questionnaire from the Track screen, which will take the Patient through a series of questions.

From within the module, Patients can select "View previous entries" and review historical records.
