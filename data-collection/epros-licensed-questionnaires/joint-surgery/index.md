Following up on patients post-surgery is a key part of their recovery. The information gathered can be shared with their care teams who can make better decisions about next steps for their patients. 

## How it works

This set of questionnaires focuses specifically on surgical outcomes related to joints, such as such as mobility, function, fatigue, and nausea. 

Huma provides a number of official PROM (Patient Reported Outcome Measure) questionnaires which address both knee and hip joints which can be asigned to patients depending on their needs. These questionnaires are usuallu scored, to help care teams gain a quick uderstanding of a patient's current situation.
