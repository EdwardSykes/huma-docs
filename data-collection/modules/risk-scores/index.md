title: Risk Score
---

Huma enables care teams to collect important health data for remote patient monitoring to help them advise and make decisions about their patients' healthcare plan. Risk scores measure the possibility that an individual will experience a medical event or specific outcome. 

## How it works

Huma uses a combination of data and patient feedback to assess to likelihood of certain health outcomes. By collecting data such as demographics, lifestyle, brief medical history, current symptoms and vital signs, through health measurements and questionnaires, Huma calculates a risk score to inform care teams and so they can make recommendations to get patients back on track and reduce the risk score.
