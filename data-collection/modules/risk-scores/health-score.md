** Welcome to your health score **

Huma Health Score is a comprehensive assessment of your overall health with a breakdown of how you score on the major domains contributing to your long-term health risk.

## How it works

Patients will complete questionnaires to determine their Huma Health Score. The score is further broken down into six different domains, and you can find educational content below regarding how you can improve within these domains.

### Patients
 
From the Track screen, Patients can select the Health Score Questionnaire, and simply by clicking “Update” can then be taken through a set of questions to assess the patient's overall health.

From within the module, Patients can view their progress in a graph and press “Show all data” to view previous results in a table. Patients can also set a daily, weekly, or monthly reminder to help keep on track.

#### Heart health

Cardiovascular fitness is an important part of your health. Measuring your resting heart rate is a way of measuring the state of your cardiovascular system and overall physical fitness. Your physical health can improve through various exercises tailored to your individual state and needs.

#### Body

Taking care of one's self includes taking care of your body, and the body composition and the ratio between the waist and the hips are valuable indicators of a Patient's physical health. Making sure these parameters are within healthy ranges will help Patients achieve physical and overall well-being.

#### Self-rated health

Many studies have shown that how Patients feel about their health is very important in determining how healthy they are. It is essential to track it over time and support its improvement.

#### Cognition

A key aspect of health is learning and acquiring new information, storing it in our brain, and reciting it again. This collection of processes in the brain is called “cognition”. Cognition can be maintained high or even improved through various activities.

#### Sleep

Sleep deprivation has a negative effect on health and well-being, which is why the duration and quality of sleep are monitored and evaluated when looking at Patient's general health. Sleep helps with metabolism, brain functioning and emotional state. It provides a form of “recovery” from activities and stress.

#### Tobacco & Alcohol

The amount of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption directly reduces the quality of overall health and puts people at risk for developing several diseases. Excessive cigarette smoking and alcohol intake has been shown to reduce lifespan and increase mortality from various diseases.
