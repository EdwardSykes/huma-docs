title: Health Score Questionnaire
---

Huma Health Score is a comprehensive assessment of a patient's overall health, providing a breakdown of scores accross six key domains which affect long-term health risks.

## How it works

Patients respond to a questionnaire which calculates their Huma Health Score. They can retake the questionnaire as many times as they wish in order to monitor their health score over time. The time and date is added automatically at the moment they make the entry (although this can be edited if needed) and patients will also be able to view all their historic results from within the module. Reminders can be set to help them stay on track and make sure they don't miss an entry.

## Domains

#### Heart health

Cardiovascular fitness is key to a healthy life. Resting heart rate is a way of measuring the state of the cardiovascular system and overall physical fitness. Physical health can be improve through exercises tailored to the individual patient's needs.

#### Body

Body composition, including the ratio between the waist and the hips, is a valuable indicator of a patient's physical health. Making sure these parameters are within healthy ranges will help patients achieve physical and overall wellbeing.

#### Self-rated health

Many studies have shown that how patients feel about their health is very important in determining how healthy they are. It is essential to track it over time and support its improvement.

#### Cognition

A key aspect of health is learning and acquiring new information, storing it in our brain and recalling it. These processes are known as cognition. Cognition can be maintained and improved through various brain training activities.

#### Sleep

Sleep helps with metabolism, brain functioning and emotional state and sleep deprivation can have a negative effect on both mental and physical wellbeing. This is why it is important to monitor the duration and quality of sleep when looking at patient's general health. Improving sleep can help patients  recover from daily stresses.

#### Tobacco & Alcohol

We know that cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption directly reduces the quality of overall health and puts people at risk for developing several diseases. Excessive cigarette smoking and alcohol intake has been shown to reduce lifespan and increase mortality from various diseases.
