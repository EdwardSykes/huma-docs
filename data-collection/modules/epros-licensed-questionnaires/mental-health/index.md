The signs and symptoms of mental health issues can vary depending on the specific circumstances facing the patient and can affect their everyday operation and functioning. Huma offers a range of questionnaires that can help care teams assist patients suffering from mental health issues and provide appropriate and timely intervention. 

## How it works

Huma provides questionnaires that help assess the mental health of the patient in the areas of [anxiety](./anxiety-level-gad-7.md), [depression](./depression-level-phq-8.md) and [perceived stress](./perceived-stress-scale.md). Patients answers questions to tell their care team how they are feeling, which helps them spot trends and identify those who might require prioritisation.
