title: Diabetes/Diabetic polyneuropathy
---

Diabetic neuropathy is a condition that can cause issues all over the body. Nerves that control movement or sensation can be affected by diabetes. Huma offers two questionnaires that help patients and care teams work together to improve their quality of life. 

## How it works

The [Diabetes Distress Score Questionnaire](./diabetes-distress-score.md) and the [Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy](./qol-dn.md) questionnaires combined collect important information that helps assess the diabetic polyneuropathy of the patient in focused areas. That data is shared with care teams in the Clinician Portal where they can look for trends and responses that might require prioritisation.
