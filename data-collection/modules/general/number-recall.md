title: Number Recall
---

While reaction time and number recall ability can be improved slightly through training, they are affected by different factors which cannot be controlled (age, sex, handedness) and those which can be changed to improve RT (alcohol, stress, exercise, drug use, illness etc.). 

## How it works

### Patients

From within the Huma Health Score, Patients will taken throught the flow for Number Recall which will measure how long a series of numbers can a person remember. 

Each number presented should be randomly selected from between 0-9 and displayed to for a total period of time equal to 1 second + 1 second for each digit shown. For example, a 2-digit sequence should be presented for 3 seconds whereas a 10-digit sequence should be presented for 11 seconds.
 
The Patient is then asked to recall the sequence, this is not timed and asked to submit once they are happy with their answer. After submitting answers are deemed ‘Correct/Incorrect’ and the Patient is given the option to continue, this repeats with the digit sequence increasing in length by 1 digit on each next ‘level’ until the Patient enters an incorrect answer. It’s unlikely that the length of this sequence will need to go beyond 30-digits.
