# Onboarding Setup
**User**: Admins

Huma aims to deliver a seamless onboarding experience for patients when they first log into the app. The onboarding experience can be customised for each deployment by selecting which modules to add. Getting users to agree to your terms and conditions, verify their identity or agree to using a proxy are all things you can include in the onboarding process. 
## How it worksâ€‹
In the deployment **App Components**, select the **Onboarding** tab.

To add a new module, click **Add onboarding** and select from the list.

Available options are:

- [Identity verification](https://github.com/huma-engineering/huma-docs/blob/43dcde40bbfb786ea6586608e1d330525fe43a4c/data-collection/AdminPortal/Managing%20Deployments/Configuring%20the%20user%20onboarding/Identity%20verification.md) - Get users to confirm identity using ID documents and photo verification
- [eConsent](https://github.com/huma-engineering/huma-docs/blob/43dcde40bbfb786ea6586608e1d330525fe43a4c/data-collection/AdminPortal/Managing%20Deployments/Configuring%20the%20user%20onboarding/eConsent.md) - Get consent from patients participating in clinical trials
- [Helper agreement](https://github.com/huma-engineering/huma-docs/blob/966f60a46f9fccc0726300743b03bd6a1786f81e/data-collection/AdminPortal/Managing%20Deployments/Configuring%20the%20user%20onboarding/Helper%20agreement.md) - Get consent from patients to allow a proxy to enter data on their behalf
- [Preferred units](https://github.com/huma-engineering/huma-docs/blob/43dcde40bbfb786ea6586608e1d330525fe43a4c/data-collection/AdminPortal/Managing%20Deployments/Configuring%20the%20user%20onboarding/Preferred%20units.md) - Ask patients and their proxies which units of measurement they prefer to use 
Use the arrowsðŸ•‚ to change the order in which the modules will be served to the patient. Itâ€™s recommended to use the above order. In particular, identity verification must come before the eConsent module in order for the signature to be recognised as 23 CFR Part 11 compliant.

Click **EditâœŽ** at the end of the line to edit the units. Click the **Delete** icon to remove modules from the list.

When you are happy with the configuration, click the button to **Save changes**.

As soon as users have completed signup, they will be asked the selected onboarding modules, then will be able to access their main App screens.
