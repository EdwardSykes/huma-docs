# Clinician Portal

The Clinician Portal is the place where care and research teams can view and track patient data. 

Huma provides all the tools needed for care teams to identify and prioritise patients who are in the most immediate need of help. For research teams, the portal can provide the insights needed for the successful running of clinical trials.

Key to the Clinician Portal is the Patient List which displays all patients along with their module data. Further detail can be found on the Patient Dashboard, where care teams can also call and message their patients. 
## Users
User roles can be managed from the portal, with a variety of permissions available for all types of user.
Organisation Staff will be able to manage multiple deployments from within the Clinician Portal.
