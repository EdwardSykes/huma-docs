In the edit window you can select the patient that you currently have open, add other patients, or select **All patients**. 

To add another patient, just start typing the patient name or email address then select the patient you want to add.

Check the box **Remove identifiable information** if you want to export only the data points and protect the patient identity. If you don’t have permission to view identifiable information, this box will be checked by default and will not be editable.
