# Assigning a clinician to a patient
**User**: Admin; Deployment Staff; 

The Huma experience connects clinician and patients so that patient data can be tracked and monitored. When a clinician connects to the portal they can find a list of the patients they are monitoring but it’s up to the Deployment staff to assign patients to clinicians so that they can be tracked.
## How it works​
On the **Patient List**, open the menu at the end of the row select **Assign clinicians**.

In the pop-out window, search for the clinicians you want to assign and check the box to select them. You can select as many as you need for your care team.
