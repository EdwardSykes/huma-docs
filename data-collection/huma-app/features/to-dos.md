**User**: Patient, Helper

The Huma App aims to simplify the process of health data tracking even when collecting multiple data points from patients through a variety of means. The To do/Timeline page is a place where patients can find their upcoming priority tasks. 

## How it worksâ€‹

The To do/Timeline screen is where you land when you log into the Huma App. The tasks that appear here are based on specific tasks set by your care team.

Each task on the To do list will indicate the date it became active and they will be listed in order of priority. Once the task is complete (or expires) it will disappear from the timeline. The main **Upcoming** list will include upcoming tasks for the next two weeks. The **Previous** list will show previous tasks up to 3 months in the past. 

Pending appointments are also displayed here when they require confirmation, as well as confirmed appointments which are upcoming.

Besides the To do list, which lets you see your top priority tasks from within the app, you can also configure your own reminders from within the modules so that you get push notifications.
