# Messages
**User**: Patient

Huma facilitates the connection between patient and care teams via both direct and indirect communication methods. The built-in messaging system allows care teams to message their patients with custom or templated messages to inform, advise or encourage them with regards to their daily tasks or care plan.

# How it worksâ€‹

The [messaging](data-collection/admin-portal/managing-deployments/general-settings/configuring-messages.md) feature is enabled and configured in the Admin Portal.

Messaging is only one-way, so you will not be able to respond to messages from your care team. 

You will be advised of new messages via a notification on your device and can find and read the message in the **Messages** section of your profile. Your care team will be able to see when you have read the message.
