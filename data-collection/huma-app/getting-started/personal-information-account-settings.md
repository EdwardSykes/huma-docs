# Personal information and account settings
**User**: Patient, Helper
The **Profile** screen contains the patientâ€™s personal information along with some account settings. It can also be used to access some of the Appâ€™s customisable features. The exact contents of the Profile screen will depend on the deployment configuration.
## How it worksâ€‹
From the App, access your **Profile** screen using the menu icon ðŸ—£.

### Personal & account detailsâ€‹

You can access and edit your basic personal information that was collected during onboarding. This might include name, gender, DoB, ID number, etc. 

You can also edit the mobile number used for 2-factor authentication and can change your password here. After making any changes, click **Save** at the top of the page.
