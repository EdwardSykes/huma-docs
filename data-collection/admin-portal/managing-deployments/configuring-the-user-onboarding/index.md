Every Deployment can have it's own unique [onboarding experience](./onboarding-setup.md) for the patient. 

Choose which modules to include from the following: [Data consent](./data-consent.md), [eConsent](./econsent.md), [Helper agreement](./helper-agreement.md), [Identity verification](./identity-verification.md), [Preferred units](./preferred-units.md), and configure each one to your own requirements.
