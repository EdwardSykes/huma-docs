# Configuring messages
**User**: Super Admin, Huma Support, Account Manager, Organisation Owner, Organisation Editor

Huma takes clinician-patient communication seriously. Messages can be configured in the deployment so that clinicians can send out pre-built messages designed to address specific issues quickly. In addition to this, custom messaging allows clinicians to write their own personalised messages to patients.
## How it worksâ€‹
When configuring your deployment, in the **App features**, check the **Messaging** checkbox to enable messaging and **Allow custom messaging** to allow clinicians to compose their own messages.

You can add some standard messages to your portal. Click **Add message** button to create a new one or the edit button to edit a current message.
