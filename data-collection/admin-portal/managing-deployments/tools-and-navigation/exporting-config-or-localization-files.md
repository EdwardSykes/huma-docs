# Exporting the configuration or localisation files
**User**: Super Admin, Huma Support, Account Manager, Organisation Owner, Organisation Editor

Once you have configured a new deployment, you can export a JSON file of the full configuration so that you can recreate it in the future or in order to integrate it with another tool. 
You can also export a different JSON containing all the copy from your deployment so that you can translate it. 
## How it works
In the Admin Portal, find your list of deployments on the **Deployments** tab. Open the dropdown menu at the end of the row and select **Export JSON** or **Generate file to translate** depending on whether you want the full code for the deployment or just the content to be translated.

A file will be downloaded to your device in JSON. The localisation file can be reuploaded in the [Languages section of the **App Configuration**](https://github.com/huma-engineering/huma-docs/blob/47cb00b72c63b8e92e338d4c55714d04154b1f5f/data-collection/AdminPortal/Managing%20Deployments/General%20Settings/Icon,%20language%20and%20labels.md).

> ðŸ›‘ **IMPORTANT**: In the case of the localisation file, please note that once you have downloaded it, your deployment configuration will be locked and you wonâ€™t be able to make any changes. For the full procedure, please refer to [this documentation](https://humatherapeutics.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DO/pages/3298689083/How-To+Log+a+Translation+Request).
