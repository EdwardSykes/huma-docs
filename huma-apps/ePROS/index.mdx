title: ePROS / Licensed Questionnaires

** Feedback from Patients is a key part of being able to offer the healthcare needed by a Clinician. **

Huma provides a feature to hold electronic and written questionnaires to deliver efficiently to the Healthcare Professionals to make informed decisions.

## How it works

In the platform, Huma provides the necessary tools to create and store patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) and distribute them to the Patients who have undergone a particular treatment.

The licensed questionnaires that Huma utilises in-app, are formed in a UX that will make the feedback easy to give, but extend the reach of people which can aid with the perspective of treatment overall.
