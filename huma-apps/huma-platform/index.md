**Huma provides digital-first care and research by creating a journey of data from Patients to Care Teams, and Participants in Clinical Trials.**

The documentation here explains how each component works and assists in the adoption of the product for all personas involved. This is achieved through various applications on both web and mobile, in combination with web-based portals for Care Teams and Site Administrators.

### Hospital at home
Our 'hospital at home' technology collects real-world patient data remotely. It connects patients and clinical teams, enables greater access to care from any location and improves efficiency for clinicians. This is achieved by lowering barriers for Patients to share the data with Care Teams that are needed to make better decisions about their health. 


### Generating data and insights in Life Sciences
Humaâ€™s digital first approach supports decentralized and hybrid clinical trials, which accelerates delivering effective treatments to patients as our DCT platform can improve trial participation, diversity, engagement and efficiency, at scale. This is accomplished by managing the data between Participants and the trial they are enrolled in, and throughout this journey will facilitate the recruitment, screening, consent, questionnaires and proxies required.

Huma technology delivers the experience for Hospital at Home and Clinical Trials through the products:
