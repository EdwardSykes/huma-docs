** Giving the control of data to Participants **

Huma aims to deliver a host of data to further clinical research in a digital environment, therefore Participants who opt into trials are required in the process of discovery. Consequently, through both regulation and Huma’s own values, consenting through an electronic means is a feature that we strive to deliver the control of a Participant’s data to themselves.

## How it works

From inside the Huma app, a Participant can accept, view, retract, and re-consent amendments to the eConsent that is currently active. This means at any time a Participant can retain all control over their data.
