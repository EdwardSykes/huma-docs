** Helping Care Teams prioritise their Patients with visualised data **

One of the goals of all Clinicians is to have the ability to prioritise Patients by looking at their statistics and current state. Allocating the attention and the care needed is important for the process of delivering healthcare in a way that does not mean that any technology stands in the way of that.

### How it works
From understanding the importance of giving the tools needed to deliver the best healthcare, all patients in the Huma platform provide the capability to see what is important with Flags and Red Amber Green (RAG). 

With this, a Clinician can see vital historical data at a glance, so that they can further assess a Patient and make better decisions for their healthcare. To add to that, the patient list can be sorted for flags to help with prioritisation and determine where urgency exists.
