** Taking care of users when first joining and every time they return **

The start of every journey in a platform is when an account is created. Huma envisions a sign-up process that is intuitive and accessible. One that enables Clinicians, Patients, and people involved in Clinical trials to be introduced into the platform without technical barriers. 

The welcoming nature of Huma is one that shows the approach and values that have gone into creating this platform and aspires to reflect this in the first instance of engaging with the platform and each and every time they come back.
