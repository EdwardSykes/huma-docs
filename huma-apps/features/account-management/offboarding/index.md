** Managing Patients at every stage of their care **

Huma facilitates the healthcare and clinical trial journey for Patients and Participants, with that every stage needs to be managed and show responsibility as people’s very sensitive data is being collected. Therefore, the end of the journey is as important to Huma for its users as every other stage.

## How is works

Given that a Clinician will have to stop the monitoring process, they can do so from the Patient details screen. In the contextual menu, “Stop monitoring patient” can be clicked and the flow begins to ensure that the Patient feels confident of the offboarding, that they are in control of the data, and any historical data is managed to an auditable standard to meet up with any regulation.
