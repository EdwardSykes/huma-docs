title: Self-managed Invitation System
---

** The Huma platform endeavours to be the tool needed for Care Teams to connect to their Patients that is simple, easy, and accessible to all. **

The first step of the journey of a Patient in Huma is to invite them to the platform, so that they can be onboarded and therefore supply the data needed for their care. The Invitational System is one that empowers Clinicians manage the entire Patient jounrney and therefore is self-managed. Huma endeavours to deliver a product that makes this process intuitive so that the technology does not stand in the way of care.

### How it works

We make bringing a Patient to the platform straightforward, by being able to add a Patient from the Patient Table, by just adding their details and an email address, or meeting the Patient where they are by creating a unique invitation link to be used in any messaging platforms they are most familiar with.

## Inviting Patients via their Messaging Platform

For Care Teams, it is important that inviting patients to the platform is easy and the technology does not act as a barrier to completing that task. In addition, the method of invitation needs to be accessible and intuitive for the Patient.

Even with email being ubiquitous, it is not the prefered form of communication for many Patients. The URL generated does not translate well to other forms of messaging such as SMS creating a barrier to entry with broken or suspicious-looking links.

### How it works

The Huma portal now provides a “Get link” button for alternate means of communication — giving Clinicians the ability to invite their Patients via methods other than email.

The URL generated is short enough to work with SMS or any popular messaging app without any issues for the invitee. This gives confidence to both Patients and Clinicians.
