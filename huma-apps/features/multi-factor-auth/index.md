** How Huma keeps your data safe **

Huma takes the responsibility of everyoneâ€™s data seriously as we are aware of the sensitivity involved. With that, it is vital that the platform is accessible and secure at all points of entry, and we build our system to cope with all eventualities.

## How it works

Huma offers 2-factor authentication for mobile and web to ensure that the person signing in is the person they say they are. This adds an extra layer of security and in the event of a comprised password then a malicious individual can be stopped before accessing any sensitive data.
