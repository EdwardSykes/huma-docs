# Modules

##### Questionnaires

When you select a questionnaire on the patient module overview page, you will be taken to the individual results of the patient's entries.Â Answers to the baseline questionnaire can be found here, such as smoking status, pre-existing conditions, medications, initial symptoms, and the time of onset.

##### Traffic light system

Some of the graphs will have a "traffic light system" to help you navigate through the patient's well being. The thresholds would be configured based on requirements per deployment.

##### Symptoms

Here, you can review the symptoms reported by the patient with time/date stamps and severity grading. You can scroll down the table to see the evolution of each individual symptom over time.
