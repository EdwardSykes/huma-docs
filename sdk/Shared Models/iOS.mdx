# iOS
**HumaModel** is a core library that provides a set of data structures and repository interfaces for working with them.

### Getting Started
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="example" label="Example" default>

We can split the models into the following categories:

### Common
  - `RepositoryError` is used to describe failures in repository callbacks.
  - `RepositoryResult` represents a result of a repository callback.
  - `RepositoryCompletion` represents a repository callback.


#### User
  - The `AnyUser` protocol defines all needed user properties and is used in other libraries. You can use the built-in `User` struct or create your own implementation.
  - To work with the user models, you have to implement the following protocols: `AnyUserSessionRepository`, `AnyUserObserveRepository`, and `AnyUserUpdateRepository`.

#### Modules
  - The `AnyPrimitive` protocol describes a value of a module result.
  - The `ModuleResult` struct represents a generic result of a module.
  - To work with module results, you have to implement the following protocols: `AnyModuleResultObserveRepository` and `AnyModuleResultSubmitRepository`.


#### Configuration
  - The `AnyConfiguration` protocol describes all parameters of a configuration used in the other libraries. 
  Some of the parameters are custom struct types; you can read the documentation in the code.
  - To work with configuration, you have to implement the following protocols: `AnyConfiguration` and `AnyConfigurationRepository`.

#### Storage
  The `FileObject` struct contains the location details of a file and is used to upload or download the files.
  - To work with storage operations, you have to implement `AnyFileRepository`.

#### Analytics
  - The library includes an extension to `AnyAnalytics` from **HumaUtils** that allows you to identify analytics with the `AnyUser` model.
