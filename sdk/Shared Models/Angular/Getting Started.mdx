## Install Dependency 

First thing is to install huma package into the project. To do that, we can use `npm` or `yarn` package managers.

npm:
```bash
npm install @huma-engineering/shared-models
```

yarn:
```bash
yarn add @huma-engineering/shared-models
```

## Project Setup

Shared models is a DEV dependency that can be directly imported into the project after installing. Currently shared modes implements
data interfaces that might be shared across different libraries and projects, such as:
- Deployment data
- Roles and permissions 
- Base modules
- User profiles

Here is usage example:

```typescript
import { BaseObject, S3Object } from '@huma-engineering/shared-models/common';
import { Profile, ProfileRole, ProfileRoleId } from '@huma-engineering/shared-models';
```
