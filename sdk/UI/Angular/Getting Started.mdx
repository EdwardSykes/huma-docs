### Install Dependency 

First thing is to install huma package into the project. To do that, we can use `npm` or `yarn` package managers.

npm:
```bash
npm install @huma/ui 
```

yarn:
```bash
yarn add @huma/ui
```

### Project Setup

Once dependency installed we need to setup project modules. There are multiple options to do that.
If it is expected to install all package modules, we can import full `HumaUIModule` package. Here is an example:

```typescript
import { HumaUiModule } from '@huma/ui';
...

@NgModule({
  imports: [HumaUiModule]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The other way would be installing only required packages to reduce application dist size. To do that, import specific module into your propect.

```typescript
import { HumaButton } from '@huma/ui';
...

@NgModule({
  imports: [HumaButton]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Styles

There are a multiple ways on how to import required styles for SDK. First way would be importing required style over LESS/SCSS import statement.
For that you may edit global style file to include:

```less
@import "@huma/ui/themes/default/index.less";
@import "@huma/ui/themes/default/notification.less";
```

The other way around would be editing `angular.json` file of the project to include build options with new styles:

```json
"<angular-project-name>": {
  "build": {
    "options": {
      ...
      "styles": [
        "node_modules/@huma/ui/themes/default/index.less",
        "node_modules/@huma/ui/themes/default/notification.less'",
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Assets

To import all required assets from SDK, we need to modify project `angular.json` settings. Here is an example how to do that:

```json
"<angular-project-name>": {
  "build": {
    "options": {
      ...
      "assets": {
        "glob": "**/*",
        "input": "./projects/huma-ui/assets",
        "output": "/assets/"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
