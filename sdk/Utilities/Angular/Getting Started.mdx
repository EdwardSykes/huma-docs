### Install Dependency 

First thing is to install huma package into the project. To do that, we can use `npm` or `yarn` package managers.

npm:
```bash
npm install @huma-engineering/utils
```

yarn:
```bash
yarn add @huma-engineering/utils
```

## Classes

All Utils classes are the static classes. Which allows to use any method of the class whithout having instance of that class.
Currently HumaUtils library implements folowing list of Utility classes:

- Array
- Browser
- Data-calculate
- Data-format
- Device
- Draggable
- Generation
- Input-type
- Time
- User-name


### Project Setup

Once dependency installed we need to setup project modules. There are multiple options to do that.
If it is expected to install all package modules, we can import full `HumaUtilsModule` package. Here is an example:

```typescript
import { HumaUtilsModule } from '@huma-engineering/utils';
...
@NgModule({
  imports: [HumaUtilsModule]
})
export class AppModule {}
```
