## Install Dependency 

First thing is to install huma package into the project. To do that, we can use `npm` or `yarn` package managers.

npm:
```bash
npm install @huma-engineering/auth
```

yarn:
```bash
yarn add @huma-engineering/auth
```

## Project Setup

Once dependency installed we are able to use `HumaAuthModule` to add authentication pages from the SDK. 
`AuthenticationModule` includes own routing rules, that are going to be used as part of the Angular router with pre-build authentication components.
In case if you would like to change the UI of the authentication but keet the same flow or API requests - you may skip importing the `AuthenticationModule` router.
To provide proper auth configuration `forRoot()` method should be used as folowing:

```typescript
import { API_CONFIG } from '@huma-engineering/utils/api';
import { HumaAuthModule } from '@huma-engineering/auth';
...

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    HumaAuthModule,
    RouterModule.forRoot([
      {
        path: 'auth',
        loadChildren: () =>
          import('huma-auth').then((m) => {
            return m.AuthenticationModule;
          }),
      }
    ])
  ],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: API_CONFIG,
      useValue: {
        hostUrl: 'https://devapi.humaapp.io',
        clientId: 'c3',
        projectId: 'p1',
      },
    }
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Configuration

All configuration fields are described by the `AuthConfig` interface.
The most important fields are:

- `clientId` - provides client identifier to the backend
- `projectId` - provides project identifier to the backend
- `hostUrl` - backend host url, used to build the enpdoints
