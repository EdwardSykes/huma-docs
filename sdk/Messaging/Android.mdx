# Android
Library that provides a messaging feature which allows to receive messages on Android app from a remote service. This feature supports **one-way** messaging where user can **only** receive messages and **not** reply to the messages.

### Getting Started
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="example" label="Example" default>

To start working with **Huma Messaging** you need to call `openMessages()` function from your code:

```korlin
HumaMessagingManager.getInstance().openMessages()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="installing" label="Installing">

1. Add the dependency in your local build.gradle file:   


```kotlin
implementation("com.huma.sdk:messaging:latest-version")
```

2. `HumaMessagingManager` require dependencies to be initialized before it in `Application` class

```kotlin
HumaUtilsManager.init(/*..*/)
HumaAuthManager.init(/*..*/)
HumaUiManager.init(/*..*/)
HumaSharedManager.init(/*..*/)
HumaCachingManager.init(/*..*/)
HumaMessagingManager.init(/*..*/)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="readme" label="Readme" default>

**Main** screen of **Huma Messaging** module contains list of latest incoming messages from a senders sorted by datetime. Newest are in the top of the list. 
There is an indicator if messages were read and count of unread messages.

By tap on the message from **Main** page will navigate to **Detail** screen with all past messages from a selected sender arranged by datetime with latest message at the bottom. Older messages will be loading by scrolling up. By navigate to that screen all messages here will be marked as read.

**Huma Messaging** supports receiving push notification with new incoming message. Implemented navigation to **Detail** messages screen by tap on push notification.
