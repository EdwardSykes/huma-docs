## Install Dependency 

First thing is to install huma package into the project. To do that, we can use `npm` or `yarn` package managers.

npm:
```bash
npm install @huma-engineering/profile
```

yarn:
```bash
yarn add @huma-engineering/profile
```

## Project Setup

Once dependency installed we are able to use `HumaProfileModule` to add profile features from the SDK. 
To import all functionality right away, `HumaProfileModule` can beimported as folowing:

```typescript
import { HumaProfileModule } from '@huma-engineering/profile';
...

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    HumaProfileModule
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
